# Decisions

### 2026-02-17: Initialize squad roster and routing
**By:** Squad (Coordinator)
**What:** Created initial team roster, routing map, and casting state for the CardGames repository.
**Why:** Team workflows require authoritative squad metadata before multi-agent work can run.

### 2026-02-17: OAuth-first auth page prioritization
**By:** Linus (Frontend)
**What:** Prioritized OAuth providers on `Login.razor` and `Register.razor` by placing `ExternalLoginPicker` first and keeping local auth forms as a secondary fallback.
**Why:** Most users are expected to use third-party sign-in; UI should guide that default without changing auth behavior or available fields.

### 2026-02-17: OAuth-first wording convention for auth pages
**By:** Linus (Frontend)
**What:** Standardized auth-page copy to present Google/Microsoft OAuth as the preferred path while keeping local email/password as a clearly labeled fallback, with no layout or logic changes.
**Why:** Reinforces OAuth-first UX intent through wording only, preserving existing auth behavior.

**Applied in:**
- `src/CardGames.Poker.Web/Components/Account/Pages/Login.razor`
- `src/CardGames.Poker.Web/Components/Account/Pages/Register.razor`
