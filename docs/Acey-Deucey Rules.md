# Acey-Deucey

## Introduction

In-Between, Acey-Deucey is a casino type game played with 2 or more players. In-Between uses a standard 52 playing card deck with Aces high and 2s low. The objective of In-Between is to wager your bets on a card’s rank being in-between two previously drawn cards.

## Set Up

To start, all players place a minimum bet into the pot.

The dealer shuffles the deck and then places two cards face up and a few inches apart into the center of the gameplay area.

## How to Play

Beginning with the player left of the dealer and proceeding clockwise, players either pass or place an additional bet of any amount on the table when it is their turn. If the player chooses to pass, then the next player gets to new cards dealt face up. If, instead, the player places a bet the dealer then places a third card in-between the previously drawn cards and turns it face up. If the third card’s rank is in-between the other cards, the betting player wins their bet amount from the pot. If the third card is not in-between the other cards, the bet made is added to the pot and play passes to the next player. If the third card is the same rank as one of the two face up cards, then the player "posts" and has to put twice their bet into the pot.

If the first face up card is an Ace, then play pauses and the player gets to choose if they want that Ace to be treated as a high card or a low card. If the second face up card is an Ace, it is always a high card.

If the pot runs out of chips, the game is over.
